## Introductions

first of all, i wanted create an extension that can decorcate the text 
almost like a snipet, but being able to styling the selected text or 
the texts on selected line. all the tools that pre-exists might be able 
to do what i want but probably 1 or 2 things on each of them.

there are a lot of file extensions that support rendered output of the contents 
like markdown and it's alternatives but they need to be rendered for ease of reading 
the texts on them. Perhaps it could be the highlighting issue but i reckon it is more than just lack of highlighting. 

the goal of this extension is for ease of reading of a document with monotype fonts. 
and most of the text editors support wrapping of the paragraph and such, however i do not like them.

i am 100% certain there will be a justify-align for paragraph extension, but it prob 
will be a standalone extension. 

my goal here is to replace rendering text document to non-easy-to-read monotype documents and it's on file extension to dot deco.
